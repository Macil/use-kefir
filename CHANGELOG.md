## 2.0.0 (2020-12-01)

- Fixed undocumented behavior where values from the stream that were functions would be treated as state-updater functions instead of as values. This behavior isn't very useful for streams and might be difficult to support in a future version of use-kefir that used a future React feature like `useMutableSource()`.

## 1.0.1 (2019-05-20)

No code changes.

- Updated package repository link so the npm page for this package links to the github repo.

## 1.0.0 (2019-05-06)

Initial release.
